Having said that, it is nevertheless useful to\nhave some insight on a couple of key aspects, fundamentally what could be called the <em>\"request wrapping\nmechanism\"</em>.\n\nWhen you feed <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span> with a url handling function, i.e. <code class=\"js\">\nrouter.get(\"/answertoall\", function(request, response) {response.end(\"42\");});</code>\n\nwhat <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span>\ndoes is to wrap that function into another, unnamed one, which has the primary mission of _\"augmenting\"_ the request\nobject and it stores said function in an array of url-handling functions, thus acting as a _middleware_ piece of code.\nAt run time, when a client invokes the matching URL, the \"middleware\" function will be called, which, after doing its trickery to \"dress\" the request object, will ultimately call the original url-handling function that was provided.\n            \nWhat does _\"augmenting-dressing\"_  the request object mean?\n\nWell, basically, <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span> provides the request object with 3 properties:\n            <ul>\n              <li>**request.get** which is an object representation of the <dfn>query string</dfn></li>\n              <li>**request.post** an object representation of what was posted, if anything</li>\n              <li>**request.body** is the union of the two previous items</li>\n            </ul>\n            It should be pointed down that regardless the transmission method, <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span>\n            takes the necessary steps to make all 3 of them true javascript objects with all that implies, JSON and all.\n            Worst case is an empty object **{}**, no errors.\n            So, you can use `request.get.whatever` for `router.get`,\n            `request.post.whatever` for `router.post`, but in any case, if you don't care about request method,\n            using `request.body.whatever` is a safe bet, most obviously useful if you do not know in advance\n            the request method, for example: <code class=\"js\">router.any(\"/threefold\", function(request, response)\n            {response.end((parseInt(request.body.number) * 3).toString();});</code>\n         </p>\n         <p>\n             Wrapping up, you just got to remember **request.get, request.post** and **request.body**\n             \nAnd that's all there is about it.\n\n### Options\n\nNSR sticks to some conventions (\"public\" as directory name for static assets, etc),\nwhich the programmer can override when instantiating the router, for instance:\n\n    var router = new Router({static_route: __dirname + \"/static\"});\nto change usage of the default \"public\" directory for static resources\n            \n\nList of default options:\n            <p>\n                <pre><code class=\"js\">\n                logging: true\n                log: console.log\n                static_route: \"#{process.cwd()}/public\"\n                serve_static: true\n                list_dir: true\n                default_home: ['index.html', 'index.htm', 'default.htm']\n                cgi_dir: \"cgi-bin\"\n                serve_cgi: true\n                serve_php: true\n                php_cgi: \"php-cgi\"\n                served_by: 'Node Simple Router'\n                software_name: 'node-simple-router'\n                admin_user: 'admin'\n                admin_pwd: 'admin'\n                use_nsr_session: true\n                avail_nsr_session_handlers: ['dispatch.memory_store', 'dispatch.text_store']\n                nsr_session_handler: 'dispatch.memory_store'\n                </code></pre>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Most of them are self explanatory, but some deserve further comments,\n                which will be added on doc completion.\n            </p>\n \n## Router API\n\nRouter object supports the following methods\n#### <dfn>get</dfn>\n_Usage:_\n\n      router.get('/users/:id', function(request, response) {\n        response.end(\"User: \" + getUserById(request.params.id).fullName);});\n          \n#### <dfn>post</dfn>\n_Usage:_\n\n    router.post('/users', function(request, response) {\n                        insertUser(request.post.user, function(new_user_id) {\n                          request.post.user.id = new_user_id;\n                          response.end(JSON.stringify(request.post.user);});\n                        });\n\n#### Handling file uploads\n<span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span> handles 'multipart/form-data' out of the box.\nWhen <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span> detects a post having enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" it\nadds to the _request_ object the properties: <em>fileName, fileLen, fileData and\nfileType</em>, which client code (your server) can handle as shown in the following usage example.\n\n_Usage:_\n\n        router.post(\"/handle_upload\", function(request, response) {\n        var encoding, fullname;\n        response.writeHead(200, {'Content-type': 'text/html'});\n        if (request.fileName) {\n           response.write(\"&lt;h2&gt;Uploaded File Data&lt;/h2&g\");\n           response.write(\"File name = \" + request.fileName + \"&lt;br/&gt;\");\n           response.write(\"File length = \" + request.fileLen + \" bytes&lt;br/&gt;\");\n           response.write(\"File type = \" + request.fileType + \"&lt;br/&gt;\");\n           fullname = \"\" + __dirname + \"/public/uploads/\" + request.fileName;\n           if (request.fileType.indexOf('text') &gt;= 0) {\n              encoding = 'utf8';\n           }\n           else {\n             encoding = 'binary';\n           }\n           return fs.writeFile(fullname, request.fileData, {encoding: encoding}, function(err) {\n             if (err) {\n               response.write(\"&lt;p style='color: red;'&gt;Something went wrong, uploaded file could not be saved.&lt;/p&gt;\");\n             }\n             else {\n               response.write('&lt;div style=\"text-align:center; padding: 1em; border: 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;\"&gt;');\n               if (request.fileType.indexOf('image') &gt;= 0) {\n                 response.write(\"&lt;img src='/uploads/\" + request.fileName + \"' /&gt;\");\n               }\n               else {\n                 response.write(\"&lt;pre&gt;\" + request.fileData + \"&lt;/pre&gt;\");\n               }\n               response.write(\"&lt;/div&gt;\");\n             }\n             response.write(\"&lt;hr/&gt;\");\n             return response.end(\"&lt;div style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"&gt;&lt;button onclick=\\\"history.back();\\\"&gt;Back&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\");\n           });\n         }\n         else {\n           response.write(\"&lt;p style='color: red;'&gt;Something went wrong, looks like nothing was uploaded.&lt;/p&gt;\");\n           return response.end(\"&lt;div style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"&gt;&lt;button onclick=\\\"history.back();\\\"&gt;Back&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\");\n         }\n      });\n      \n#### <dfn>put</dfn>\n_Usage:_\n\n    router.put('/users', function(request, response) {\n        updateUser(request.post.user, function(updated_user_id) {\n        response.end(updated_user_id);})\n    });                use_nsr_session: true<br/>\n                avail_nsr_session_handlers: ['dispatch.memory_store', 'dispatch.text_store']<br/>\n                nsr_session_handler: 'dispatch.memory_store'<br/>\n\n\n#### <dfn>patch</dfn>\nA variant for PUT\n\n_Usage:_\n\n    router.patch('/users', function(request, response) {\n        updateUser(request.post.user, function(updated_user_id) {\n        response.end(updated_user_id);});\n    });\n\n#### <dfn>delete</dfn>\n\n_Usage:_\n\n    router.delete('/users', function(request, response) {\n        deleteUser(request.post.user_id, function(user_id) {\n        response.end(user_id);});\n    });\n\n#### <dfn>any</dfn>\nTo be used when the request method is not known in advance. Sort of \"catch all\"\n\n_Usage:_\n\n    // Observe usage of 'request.body' as the union of 'request.get' and 'request.post'\n    router.any('/users', function(request, response) {\n        response.end(\"User: \" + getUserById(request.body.user_id).fullName);}); \n\n\n### <dfn>Complementary methods</dfn>\n \nUp to here, all the enumerated methods are directly related to <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span> primary activity: routing.\n\nThey are what you will use 90% of the time.\n\nWhat follows are method loosely related to routing activity, but are the ones that give <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span> some of its distinctiveness.\n\n#### <dfn>proxy_pass</dfn>\n\nTo deliver to the client the contents of an url from another server\n\n_Usage:_\n\n    router.get('/whatismyip', function(request, response) {\n        router.proxy_pass('http://testing.savos.ods.org/wimi', response);});\n\n#### <dfn><abbr title=\"Common Gateway Interface\">cgi</abbr></dfn>\n\nTo pass the client the results of an external CGI program.\n\nThis one deserves an additional comment on its usefulness. While some - many perhaps - would argue that CGI doesn't make any sense from a Node.js development perspective, I still it's a worthy inclusion for a couple of reasons\n - First of all, you may have a legacy CGI module that you want/need to use in your brand new Node.js server - would you rewrite, for instance, Crafty, the chess engine, in Node?\n - Writing programs that can talk to each other through standard means (stdin, stdout) has passed the test of time, and I think it has it niche even in the web server world.\n - If performance is a concern - and it should be - the present considerations still stand for the next item: SCGI, which NSR also supports. But there would not have been SCGI without CGI\n - Last but not least, CGI support makes the same sense in the context of a Node.js web server thant it does in Nginx, Apache, etc.. I'm not aware of anybody suggestiong CGI support should be dropped from any of them.\n\n_Usage:_\n\n<samp>\n    By default, any static resource having a path that includes the router option 'cgi-dir'\n    (which defaults to \"cgi-bin\") will be treated by <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span>\n    as a cgi program, provided the router option 'serve_cgi' is true.\n    For example, the uri: `/cgi-bin/hello.py` will be handled as a CGI program.\n    On the other hand, you can invoke directly the cgi method of the router, like so:\n    `router.cgi('/hidden-cgi-dir/mycgi.rb', request, response);`\n    Nevertheless, such way of using it is discouraged as it does not follow CGI standard\n    guidelines.\n</samp>\n\n#### <dfn>scgi_pass</dfn>\n                            \n\nTo pass the client the results of an external program running under the [SCGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCGI) protocol.\n\nSame considerations as those pertaining to CGI, with the added benefit of not having to spawn a new process each time.\n\nWhy SCGI and not <dfn title=\"Fast CGI\">FCGI</dfn>? Well, SCGI protocol was far easier to implement, and I really couldn't find significant performance differences between the two. FCGI may be implenented in future versions.\n\n_Usage:_\n\n    //Example SCGI invocation. Output will be provided by a SCGI process listening on tcp port 26000.\n    router.post(\"/scgi\", function(request, response) {\n      router.scgi_pass(26000, request, response);\n    });\n\nThe first parameter for scgi_pass is the port number (for tcp sockets)\nor the socket name (for unix sockets) at which the SCGI process is listening.\n\n#### <dfn>render_template</dfn>\n                            \n\nTo provide rudimentary template handling without compromising the goal of keeping <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span> lean and simple.\n\nEven though templating is not directly related to routing, having a micro-templating utility was considered handy.\n\nIt is basically a naive implementation of [mustache.js](http://mustache.github.io/), which tries to follow the [spec](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html), but at its current stage lacks partials and lambdas. Template handling as you would with any mustache template, as shown in the following example.\n\n_Usage:_\n\n    router.get(\"/greet_user/:user_id\", function(request, response) {\n      get_user_by_id(request.params.user_id, function (user) {\n        template_str = \"&lt;h2&gt;Hello, {{ name }}!&lt;h2&gt;\";\n        compiled_str = router.render_template(template_str, user); // returns \"&lt;h2&gt;Hello, Joe Router!&lt;h2&gt;\"\n        response.end(compiled_str);\n      }\n    });\n\nNew in version 0.8.8: `render_template_file(fileName, context, callback, keep_tokens)` was added\nThe method signature is almost the same than for **render_template** with 2 differences worth noting\n\n* The first parameter is a string containing the file name, not the template string itself.\n\n* There is a new parameter, previous to last one: a callback function with the following signature:\n`cb(exists, rendered_text);`. The reason for this is that obviously file retrieval is an async IO  operation and as such it needs a callback, which **render_template** doesn't need as there is no IO involved.\n                                \nObviously it would have been better to keep only one method (**render_template**), letting it guess if the first parameter is  a file name or a template string, but doing it that way would introduce a backward incompatibility since **render_template** returns a string, while becoming async would make it need a callback. So... too late to regret. It's not big deal, anyway..\n\n\n#### <dfn>Session handling</dfn>\n\n\nThis section deals with session handling utilities built in with NSR.\n\n<p>\n    <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span> augments the request object with a <em>nsr_session</em> object\n    unless the option <em>use_nsr_session</em> is set to a falsy value (defaults to true).<br/>\n    <strong><em>nsr_session</em></strong> is a javascript object that holds the session keys and values\n    defined by the application. Incidentally, the reason <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span> uses\n    <em>request.nsr_session</em> and not <em>request.session</em> is to avoid name collision in case\n    that a separate session handling mechanism is used.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Options related to session handling:\n    <ul style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n       <li><strong>use_nsr_session</strong> Set <em>nsr_session</em> on or off</li>\n       <li><strong>avail_nsr_session_handlers</strong> Low level functions that perform the real action. See below for details</li>\n       <li><strong>nsr_session_handler</strong> The one handler currently selected</li>\n    </ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Methods related to session handling:\n    <ul style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n        <li><code>addSessionHandler(function, function_name)</code> Add your own function to the list of session handlers</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: 1em;\"><code>setSessionHandler(func_name_or_ordinal)</code> Tell <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span> which of the available handlers to use (defaults to 0, 'memory_store').</li>\n        <li><code>getSession(request, callback)</code> Get the current <em>request.nsr_session</em>.</li>\n        <li><code>setSession(request, session_object, callback)</code> Set the current <em>request.nsr_session</em> with the provided session_object.</li>\n        <li><code>updateSession(request, session_object, callback)</code> Update the current <em>request.nsr_session</em> with the provided session_object, keeping not included keys and adding-updating keys present in session_object.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 1em;\">\n        The three latter methods are convenience wrappers to access the low level method that handles <em>nsr_session</em>\n        which is responsible for the real implementation of the session mechanism.<br/>\n        The 3 are asynchronous, having the <em>nsr_session</em> returned as the only argument to the callback function.<br/>\n        Two low level handlers are provided built in: <em>memory_store</em> (default) and <em>text_store</em> (serializes each session to a file named by the session ID)<br/>\n        If you don't need/want to construct your own implementation, you don't need to know a thing\n        about it, but if you want to roll your own (for instance, if you want to save sessions to a database or a remote server)\n        here are a couple of things that you should keey in mind:\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 1em;\">\n      <span style=\"1em; padding-left: 3em;\">Function signature: <code>var db_store = function(request, opcode, sess_obj, callback);</code></span><br/>\n      <span style=\"1em; padding-left: 3em;\">Having a look at the source code used in <em>memory_store</em> and <em>text_store</em> should provide a fairly good idea of how things should work</span><br/>\n      <span style=\"1em; padding-left: 3em;\">In order to put your brand new session handler to work, you have to</span><br/>\n      <span style=\"1em; padding-left: 4em;\">1) Register it with <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span> by means of <em>addSessionHandler</em></span><br/>\n      <span style=\"1em; padding-left: 4em;\">2) Put it to use with <em>setSessionHandler</em></span><br/>\n    </div>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    You can see the session machinery in action in the <a href=\"http://node-simple-router.herokuapp.com/session\">Session Handling</a> section of the demo site.<br/>\n    By all means, review the code that makes it work in <em>test/server.js</em> or <em>test/server.coffee</em> if you are so inclined.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"panel panel-primary\">\n    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Utilities</h3>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n        <p>\n            There are a bunch of utilities that can make your job easier, such as mk-server, the standalone tool\n            that will generate a <span class=\"nsr\">NSR</span> driven web server ready to go, cookie handling, uuid\n            generation, built-in async or promises (flow-control routines), but these are - rather, will be - fully commented in\n            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/sandy98/node-simple-router/wiki/Utils\">utilities section of\n            NSR wiki</a>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n### Real time\n\nBeginning with v0.9.0 NSR becomes real time.
